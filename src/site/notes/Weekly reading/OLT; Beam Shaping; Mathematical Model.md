# Introduction
## What is Beam Shaping?
Adjusting the spatial intensity distribution and phase characteristics of laser beams[1-2], which vary greatly in performance in metal 3D printing[3], can be achieved by devices such as DM and GS.
- **DM:** The deformable mirror consists of a flexible glass film and an electric actuator, which is manipulated to reflect light by stretching the film to change its curvature[4].

-  **GS:** Control the angle of rotation of the mirror to achieve a different angle of reflection of light, thereby regulating the laser, can be achieved through the $x$, $y$ direction of the mirror on the plane of the control.
