# Basic Laws of Electromagnetic Theory
A charge affects and is affected by other charges around it, and can be thought of as exciting some substance in space through which it interacts, which we call a field. Then we have: $\vec{F_{E}}=q\vec{E}$, and similarly the magnetic field can be defined: $\vec{F_{B}}=q \vec{v} \times \vec{B}$.
## Faraday's Introduction Law
Obviously a stationary conductor with a stable magnetic field will not generate an electromotive force, otherwise a conductor placed in a magnetic field would spontaneously combust. In addition, we require the conductor to be a closed loop. The magnitude of the electric potential emf is related to the magnetic flux $\Phi$ of the non-closed surface enclosed by the conductor and we have the following relation:
$$\begin{align}
&\Phi_{M}=BA\cos \theta \\
&emf=-\frac{{d\Phi }}{dt}
\end{align}$$

According to the concept of electromotive force, from the perspective of energy, to analyze the charge and electric field, we have:
$$
emf=-\oint_{C}Edl=-\frac{{d \Phi}}{dt}=-\frac{d}{dt} {\iint_{S}\vec{B}d \vec{S}}
$$
Obviously, here too, the conductor is required to be a closed loop, and further, we want to examine the relationship between the magnetic field and the electric field itself, so we often bring the conductor to rest, which is quite common, such as placing a coil in a varying magnetic field, and then we have:
$$
-\oint_{C}Edl={\iint_{S} \frac{{\partial\vec{B}}}{\partial t} d \vec{S}}
$$
**This suggests that a changing magnetic field over time is accompanied by an electric field**
## Gauss's Law-Electric
Earlier we discussed the interaction between electric and magnetic fields, next we discuss how charges excite electric fields in space.
It is possible to hypothesize that the electric field is flowing and that the source is charge, borrowing here the idea of equipotential surfaces, and that a flux will be generated by this flowing material as it passes through some surface of equal electric field strength. Experiments have shown that this flow is proportional to the amount of charge contained within this surface:
$$
\unicode{8751}_{A}\vec{E}{d}\vec{S}=\frac{1}{\epsilon_{0}}\Sigma q=\frac{1}{\epsilon_{0}}\iiint_{V}\rho dV
$$
Where $\epsilon$ is the capacitance, which characterizes the degree of penetration of the material by the electric field in which it is placed, the role of the formula is to make the left and right scales equal, $\epsilon_0$ is the vacuum capacitance, we can define the dielectric constant $K_{E} = \frac{\epsilon_0}{\epsilon}$, the magnitude of this value is related to the speed of light in the medium.
